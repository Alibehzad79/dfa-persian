# Conclusion



We’re now at the end of the book but only the beginning of what can be accomplished with
`Django REST Framework`. Over the course of three different projects—Library API, Todo API, and
Blog API—we have built progressively more complex web APIs from scratch. And it’s no accident
that at every step along the way, Django REST Framework provides built-in features to make our
life easier.

If you’ve never built web APIs before with another framework be forewarned that you’ve been
spoiled. And if you have, rest assured this book only scratches the surface of what `Django REST
Framework` can do. The official [documentation](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is an excellent resource for further exploration
now that you have a handle on the basics.
  
### Next Steps

The biggest area worthy of further exploration is testing. Traditional Django tests can and should
be applied to any web API project, but there is also a [whole suite](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/) of tools in Django REST
Framework just for testing API requests.
  
A good next step is to implement the pastebin API covered in the [official DRF tutorial](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/). I’ve even
written an updated [beginners guide](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners) to it that features step-by-step instructions.
  
Third-party packages are as essential to Django REST Framework development as they are to
Django itself. A complete listing can be found at [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/) or a curated list on the
[awesome-django](https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django) repo on Github.
  
  
### Giving Thanks  

  
While the Django community is quite large and relies on the hard work of many individuals, Django REST Framework is much smaller in comparison. It was initially created by [Tom
Christie](http://www.tomchristie.com/), an English software engineer who now works on it full-time thanks to open-source
funding. He still leads active development. If you enjoy working with Django REST Framework,
please consider taking a moment to personally [thank him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_tomchristie)
.
And thank you for reading along and supporting my work. If you purchased the book on Amazon,
please consider leaving an honest review: they make an enormous impact on book sales and help
me continue to produce both books and free Django content which I love doing.
